✈️ Aviation Accident Analysis
🧠 Business Understanding
🎯 Stakeholders
This analysis is of critical interest to multiple aviation-related stakeholders, including:

Civil aviation authorities

Airline operators

Aviation safety boards

The general public

Media, mainly to raise awareness and inform policy discourse

❓ Primary Questions
The project seeks to answer the following key questions:

What are the most common causes of aviation accidents?

Which phases of flight are most vulnerable to incidents?

Are there patterns linked to aircraft category, weather conditions, or flight purpose?

What are the injury trends across different types of accidents?

📊 Data Understanding and Analysis
The dataset was explored using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights.

🔹 Univariate Analysis
Focused on distributions of key variables, especially:

Total.Fatal.Injuries

Total.Serious.Injuries

These plots revealed how injuries vary in frequency and intensity across incidents.

Business Insight: Helps aviation regulators and emergency services identify common injury patterns and prioritize training and response strategies accordingly.

🔸 Bivariate Analysis
📌 Aircraft Category vs. Injury Severity
A stacked bar plot visualized how different aircraft categories relate to injury severity.

Business Insight: Enables regulators and manufacturers to target safety protocols or design improvements for aircraft with higher risk profiles.

📌 Broad Phase of Flight
Plots illustrated which flight phases (e.g., landing, takeoff) are most accident-prone.

Business Insight: Informs pilot training programs and flight procedures to emphasize caution during critical flight phases.

📌 Weather Conditions and Injury Severity
Visualized using bar charts and boxplots.

Business Insight: Guides risk-based operational decisions, such as delaying flights in adverse weather or improving equipment and training.

📌 Purpose of Flight
Analysis of serious injuries by Purpose.of.flight helped assess risk by mission profile (e.g., personal vs. business flights).

Business Insight: May prompt regulatory scrutiny of private/personal flights or impact insurance risk assessment.

🔺 Multivariate Analysis
📌 Correlation Heatmap of Injury Types
A heatmap showed strong positive correlations between injury types (e.g., serious and minor injuries often co-occur).

Low correlation with the number of uninjured passengers indicates injury clustering in high-impact events.

Business Insight: Helps in building severity index models and disaster response planning.

✅ Conclusion
This analysis provides crucial insights into where and why aviation accidents happen, and how risk can be better managed through targeted intervention.

It directly supports:

Data-driven safety improvements

Enhanced regulatory oversight

Improved pilot and crew preparedness

Informed decision-making during poor weather conditions

Aircraft design reviews by manufacturers
